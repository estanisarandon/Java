Johnny was right!
They kept the key under the door mat.
Who would have imagined that was going to be so easy
to break in the mansion on Bourbon street??
... Now lets focus. You need to hurry up find the safe and open it as soon as possible!

The view from here is amazing!
I can see directly into the neighbors bedroom.
Who would buy a mansion with such a bad view?

As soon as the safe opens, you take all the jewellery in your bag
and run straight to the front door.
Outside the darkness of the night starts to fade out with the sunrise.
You run away as fast as you can while you can not control how your mouth
turns into a big smile...
and you think for yourself:

Johnny was right!

The same phrase is written in all pages:
"Remember, remember, the 5th of November..."

... This person must have been obsessed with that date!
